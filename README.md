# Xamarin - Regula Document Reader
Regula Document Reader SDK allows you to read various kinds of identification documents, passports, driving licenses, ID cards, etc. All processing is performed completely ***offline*** on your device. No any data leaving your device.

You can use native camera to scan the documents or image from gallery for extract all data from it.

We have provided a simple application that demonstrates the ***API*** calls you can use to interact with the DocumentReader Library.
